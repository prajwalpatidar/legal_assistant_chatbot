# LEGAL ASSISTANT CHATBOT

Legal Counsel AI is a web-based AI chatbot designed to provide legal explanations and guidance through a conversational interface.
The application is built using Streamlit for the frontend and Google Gemini API for generating intelligent legal responses.
Users can ask questions related to laws, statutes, case scenarios, and general legal concepts in natural language.
The chatbot maintains session-based chat history to ensure a smooth conversational experience.
A clean and professional UI is created using Streamlit’s chat components and custom HTML styling.
The application uses the Gemini Flash model for fast and efficient responses.
For public access and live demos, ngrok is used to expose the local Streamlit server to the internet.
The project follows best practices by storing API keys using environment variables.
This system is intended for educational and informational purposes only and does not replace professional legal advice.
The project is ideal for hackathons, academic demos, and LegalTech prototypes.
